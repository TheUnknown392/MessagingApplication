Dealing with get_message and how messages are handled:
    1. Making a thread that will iterate through the client socket and check for input Buffer inputs of each socket to minimize creating too much threads and reuse same Connection, Statements.

Dealing with message->GUI, message->database, Sender seperation:
    1. Using Queue:
        a. Message will go to a Queue
        b. The queue will recieve <fingerprint/sid>:<message>
        c. A single thread will handel the queue to first, save message into database then send it to swing
        c. Swing will handel showing message correctly with properly seperated infos.

Dealing with loading messages into swing:
    1. Swing will have an always active Connection to the database to query different messages.

Dealing with intergration of frontend and backend:
    1. Creating some kind of class to send important data by argument instead of importing global variables directly?
